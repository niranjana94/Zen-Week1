WHY WE NEED HEADER TAG?

The <header> element is one of several new semantic document tags introduced with HTML5.

The <header> element is intended to usually contain the section’s heading and used to wrap a section’s table of contents, a search form, or any relevant logos.

It requires a starting tag as well as an end tag.
